# README

This directory contains the raw data as it was collected. The raw data was added without any modification and scripts in `data/src/` were used to prepare analysis-ready data in `/data/derived_data/`.  Sub-directories are structured by team in rbtl-fs22.

## `raw_data/TEAM_NAME`

Survey data (UserResponses.csv) are downloaded as a CSV from [SelectSurvey](https://selectsurvey.ethz.ch/), a tool offered by ETH Zurich. Waste characterisation data tables were created by students.
