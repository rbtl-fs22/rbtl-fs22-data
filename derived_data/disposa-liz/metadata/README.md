# Methodological information

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

Bins where collected in Bellvue from the ERZ. Then they where weighted with a bathroom scale, sorted and single waste categories where weighted with help of a kitchen or a bathroom scale. Cigarettes where sorted out and counted (see method section of the main report)

The survey questions were asked to random people passing trough Bellevue tram station. Every third person passing by the person standing at one end of the station and doing the survey was asked to participate. Random sampling was used.
